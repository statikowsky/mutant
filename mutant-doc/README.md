Mutant is a small framework for writing Kotlin web applications.

It aims to be fun and hassle free - productive and frictionless.

Mutant is more of a kit of modules and utils than a full blown 
framework.  
Pick what you need, throw away the rest!

**_ðŸ’£  Mutant is a homebrew project. Stuff might go boom! ðŸ’£_** 

To get up and running with Mutant quickly visit the [Quickstart](quickstart/quickstart.md) guide.
